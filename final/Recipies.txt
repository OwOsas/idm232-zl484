1½ tablespoons ground cardamom ||
¾ teaspoon ground cinnamon ||
¼ teaspoon ground mace ||
¼ teaspoon ground cloves ||
½ teaspoon ground grains of paradise ||

This warming blend of spices brings to life any cold-weather recipe that includes it. The warmth of the cardamom and cinnamon is balanced by the bite of mace, love, and grains, making it a solid addition to desserts, baking, and hot drinks.

1. Mix together all of the ground ingredients; then store in a small airtight jar.

STORMCLOAK SEASONING

2 teaspoons dried dill ||
½ teaspoon grains of paradise ||
1 teaspoon mustard powder ||
2 teaspoons fennel seeds ||

This is one of the most popular seasoning mixes across the breadth of Skyrim, where nearly every garden boasts a little corner dedicated to growing most of these ingredients. The grains of paradise are imported, and if the cost is too dear, ordinary black pepper can be substituted. It makes for a mixture that goes well with vegetables, fish, meat, and savory baking.

1. Crush or grind all the ingredients together using a mortar and pestle or a clean spice grinder, then store in a small airtight jar.

Imperial Seasoning
3 teaspoons dried marjoram||
3 teaspoons dried savory||
1 teaspoon coriander seeds||
¼ teaspoon white pepper||

Brought by Imperial troops and their regiment cooks, this mix
has put down roots and is gaining in popularity in Skyrim, even if the Imperials themselves are not. It's a unique combination of savory flavors and a bright citrus profile lent by the coriander, and it is delicious on vegetables and fish.

1½ cups whole milk  ||
2 teaspoons cornstarch ||
2 tablespoons sugar ||
2 eggs ||
Dash of almond extract ||

A good custard sauce should be thick and creamy, and is equally delicious poured over desserts as it is eaten straight off the spoon. The shaggy cows of Skyrim give especially good milk for custard, as it is rich with the flavors of their mountainside grazing.

1. Combine the milk, cornstarch, sugar, and eggs in a small saucepan
over medium heat. Whisk continuously while the mixture heats up,
until the eggs are completely incorporated.
||
2. Stir occasionally for 6 to 8 minutes, until the custard is thick enough
to coat the back of a spoon; it should be around 160°F.
||
3. Remove from the heat and stir in the almond flavoring extract, then
strain into a clean small pitcher.

BAKED ASH YAMS
Baked Ash Yams

4 large yams||
r recipe Spiced Butter||
¼ cup crumbled goat cheese||
Parsley, minced, for garnishing||

Ash yams are one of the few vegetables that thrives in Morrowind's climate, especially after the volcanic explosion of the Red Mountain. Some of the Dunmer fleeing that devastation thoughtfully packed yams and introduced them to Skyrim, where some Nords have added their. own distinct flavors to this recipe.

1. Preheat the oven to 42 5°F. Clean and dry the yams, then prick them
all over several times with a knife.
||
2. Place the yams directly on an oven rack placed in the middle
position with a baking sheet on the rack below to catch any
drippings. Bake for 45 to 60 minutes, or until you can easily pierce
each yam with a knife. Remove from the oven.
||
3. Wrapping one yam at a time in a kitchen towel, cut a large X on the
top of each and press on both ends of the yam to open the cuts. Top
with as much Spiced Butter as you like, then sprinkle goat cheese
and parsley over the top to finish.

Grilled Leeks

4 large leeks||
2 tablespoons olive oil||
2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese||
Salt and pepper||


Although leeks can be a little finicky to grow, it's no wonder they thrive around all the riverlands in Skyrirn. This rugged vegetable is popular in stews and savory pies, but it is also delicious in its own right and can often be spied gracing the tables of the rich and poor alike.

1. Begin by cutting off the tough dark green tops of the leeks, leaving the more tender white and paler green sections. Don't cut off the root end, which will help the leeks stay together while cooking. Slice each leek in half and rinse thoroughly to remove any dirt.
||
2 . Bring a large pot of water to a boil over high heat and drop the leeks in, letting them cook until they begin to soften, about 5 minutes. Remove from the pot and place in a bowl of ice water to stop them from continuing to cook and also hold the color.
||
3. In a wide frying pan, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat. Place the leeks cut-side down in the pan and cook for several minutes until they are starting to brown. Transfer to a serving plate, sprinkle with Parmesan cheese, and season with salt and pepper to taste.

Braided Bread

1 cup warm milk||
¼ cup packed brown sugar||
2 tablespoons melted unsalted butter||
2 teaspoons instant dry yeast||
1 teaspoon Nord Spices||
2 eggs, divided||
½ cup mixed nuts and dried fruit such as walnuts,||
pecans, dried apricots, and dates||
3 cups whole wheat flour||
2 cups all-purpose flour||

Some recipes in Skyrim, like this one, are reserved for special occasions. This beautiful bread is made in the heart of midwinter, when stores are running low and better weather seems a long way off. It makes use of some preciously guarded ingredients with the inclusion of dried fruit, nuts, and spices. All in all, it ·makes a special loaf that promises better days to come, while celebrating the harvest of the previous year.

1. Combine the milk, brown sugar, butter, yeast, Nord spice, and 1 of the eggs in a medium bowl. Stir in the nuts and dried fruit, then mix in the flour. Stir to combine the ingredients until they come together into a nice dough that is not too sticky.
||
2. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface and knead for several minutes, until it bounces back when poked. Cover with a damp cloth and put in a warm place to rise for about 1 hour, or until doubled in size.
||
3. Preheat the oven to 450°F and grease a baking sheet with butter or cover with parchment paper. Divide the dough into 3 equal sections and roll them between your hands or on a work surface to create ropes about 14 inches long. Pinch one end of the ropes together, then place on the baking sheet. Braid the ropes .into a fairly tight braid, then cover again with a cloth to allow to double in size, about an hour.
||
4. Beat the remaining egg in a small bowl and brush it onto the dough. Bake for about 25 minutes, until the bread is a dark and glossy. Let the loaf cool for at least 1 5 minutes before slicing into it.

Meadow Rye Bread

1 cup whole wheat flour||
1 ½ cups rye flour||
¼ cup packed brown sugar||
1 tablespoon baking soda||
1 teaspoon salt||
½ cup dried currants||
½ cup stout beer||
½ cup buttermilk||

This easy bread makes a flavorful accompaniment to any soup but is especially good with creamy varieties. These loaves can commonly be found in tavern kitchens, where their quick baking time means more satisfied customers.\

1. Preheat the oven to 400°F.
||
2 . In a medium bowl, combine the whole wheat flour, rye flour, brown sugar, baking soda, salt, and currants. Add the beer, then gradually mix in the buttermilk until you have a dough that is not too sticky to handle. Turn out onto a lightly floured surface and knead a few times to make sure everything is evenly distributed.
||
3. Form into a large rounded oblong loaf and transfer to a baking sheet. Score the top of the dough in a decorative pattern, then bake for about 40 minutes; the bread should sound hollow when tapped on the bottom.

Cheese Scones

2 cups all-purpose flour||
2 tablespoons sugar||
2 teaspoons baking powder||
½ teaspoon mustard powder||
½ teaspoon salt||
¼ cup (½ stick) cold unsalted butter, cubed||
½ cup sour cream||
1 cup shredded aged cheddar cheese||
¾ cup buttermilk||
1 egg, lightly beaten||
2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese||

While scones are often considered a breakfast item, their versatility makes them prime candidates for meals later in the day, especially when given a slightly more savory touch. Feel free to try this recipe with different types of cheese. Eidar and mammoth cheeses are popular in Skyrim, while more adventurous folk can experiment with scuttle from Morrowind made from the .flesh of local beetles but similar to cheese. These flaky treats are delicious still warm from the oven and dripping with fresh butter.

1. Preheat the oven to 400°F. In a large bowl, combine the flour, sugar, baking powder, mustard powder, and salt. Rub in the butter with your fingers until you have a fine, crumbly texture.

2. Add the sour cream, stirring until it has been evenly distributed. Mix in the cheese, then add a little buttermilk at a time until you get a good dough with a consistency that isn't too dry or too wet. 
||
3. Lightly flour a work surface and turn out the dough. Press the dough flat and fold it over onto itself a few times to give the scones some layers, then press out to about ½ inch thick in a roughly circular shape. Using a sharp knife, slice the dough into irregular triangles and place them on a baking sheet that has been greased with butter or lined with parchment. 
||
4. Brush the scones with beaten egg and sprinkle with Parmesan cheese, then bake for 15 minutes, or until golden and baked through.

APPLE CABBAGE STEW
Apple Cabbage Stew

2 tablespoons unsalted butter||
1 leek, white parts only, sliced thin||
½ head green cabbage, chopped thin||
1 teaspoon dried thyme, plus more for garnishing||
6 cups chicken broth||
1 or 2 apples, red or green, cored and diced||

The Imperials prefer a version of this dish that uses red cabbage, which they say is sweeter, but true N ords are unwavering in their affection for this traditional recipe. It produces a richly flavored broth that is both nutritious and delicious, despite the limited ingredient list. 

1. Melt the butter in a large saute pan and add the leeks. Cook for a few minutes, until soft and just shy of browning, then add the cabbage. 
||
2. Cook for about 10 minutes or until the cabbage has softened considerably. Add the thyme and broth, followed by the apple. Cook· for about 15 minutes more, until the apples are softened to your taste. Garnish with an extra sprinkle of thyme to serve. 

¼ pound bacon, diced||
2 medium russet or 2 large||
yellow potatoes, peeled and diced||
1 leek, white and light green parts sliced||
One ro-ounce can of baby clams or canned seafood mix, with their juices||
1 teaspoon Imperial Seasoning||
2 cups fish broth||
2 to 4 cups water, as needed||
2 tablespoons unsalted butter||
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour||
1 cup whole milk||

Nordic barnacles, clams, oysters, mudcrabs, and a variety of fish are often included in this chowder, depending on the catch of the day. Unsurprisingly, it's a popular staple in coastal cities such as Solitude and Winterhold, where every inn and tavern has a steaming cauldron of chowder going in the kitchen. 

1. Cover the bottom of a large saucepan with the bacon, followed by layers of the 
potatoes, leeks, and clams or seafood mix with their juice. Sprinkle the Imperial 
Seasoning over the top, then pour in the fish broth. Add enough water until all of 
the ingredients are covered,. and set over medium heat to cook for about 30 minutes, 
until potatoes are soft and flavors have melded together. 
||
2. In a small saucepan over medium heat, melt the butter and stir in the flour. 
While whisking, add the milk and stir until it thickens·. Pour this into the large 
pan with all the other ingredients and cook s to 10 more minutes to thicken the 
broth. 
||
Tip:
For a slightly more sophisticated version, cook some additional bacon to be 
extra crispy, crumble it, and add it as a garnish just before serving. 

2 pounds beef short ribs||
1 tablespoon olive oil||
¼ cup port wine||
5 cups beef stock||
1 or 2 medium carrots, peeled and diced||
1 or 2 medium parsnips, peeled and diced||
2 cloves garlic, minced||
½ cup farro or barley||
Salt and pepper||

This is one of Skyrim's most rustic soups, made in the far-flung small villages and  hunting camps that lie a long way from cities, where only the most adventurous might wander nd every bit of food is considered precious, with nothing wasted. The rib bones  nocking about at the bottom of the pot might seem a little dubious, but they give the broth  extra nutrients that are essential for surviving long spells of frigid temperatures. This  ish is especially helpful during recovery if one has taken a farro in the knee. 

1. Season the ribs liberally with salt and pepper. Add the oil to a medium saucepan over medium heat, then brown the ribs in the bottom of the pot. Pour in the port wine, followed by the stock. Bring to a boil and cook with the pot partially covered, for about 1 hour, occasionally skimming off excess fat from the top. 
||
2 . Add the carrots, parsnips, leeks, garlic, and the farro or barley, 1 leek, white and light green then cook for 1 hour more, or until the grains are tender and the meat has begun falling from the bone. At this point, if you like, you can pull the meat out, cut it into smaller chunks, and then add it parts sliced back into the stew. 
||
3. This soup, like many, is best the next day when flavors have been allowed to mingle. Place the soup in the refrigerator overnight. Then before reheating the next day, skim any remaining fat from the top of the pot. 

2 tablespoons unsalted butter||
1 small onion, minced||
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour||
2 cups chicken broth, plus more as needed||
½ cup whole milk||
3 or 4 medium russet potatoes, peeled and cubed (about 1 pound)||
½ cup shredded cheddar cheese||
1 teaspoon Stormcloak Seasoning (page 25)||
½ cup heavy cream cooked, crumbled bacon for garnishing (optional)||

This dish is a staple at every farmstead and crofter's cottage across Skyrim. Simple but hearty, it gives a bone-deep warmth that better prepares anyone for the day's labors ahead, be they adventuring, tending a shop, or working the fields. 

1. Melt the butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add the onion and cook for several minutes, until the onion is soft and fragrant. Sprinkle the flour in and stir to combine before continuing to cook for a few minutes more, until the fl.our is fully incorporated. 
||
2. Add the chicken broth and milk, followed by the cubed potatoes. Turn up the heat so the mixture simmers, and cook until the potatoes are quite soft, about 15 minutes. Using an immersion blender or a potato masher, blend the soup until it is an even texture. Add the cheddar cheese, Stormcloak Seasoning, and just enough of the cream to get the consistency you like. Ladle into serving dishes and top with crumbled bacon, if desired. 

Tips:
This recipe can easily be scaled up by simply adding roughly one additional potato
for each serving, and increasing the liquid and cheese accordingly.

2 teaspoons crushed juniper berries||
1 cup white wine||
Splash of apple cider vinegar or white wine vinegar||
1 pound sea scallops||
2 or 3 bacon strips||
6 tablespoons unsalted butter||
2 cloves garlic, minced||
2 tablespoons maple syrup||

Most Nords, from Solitude to Windhelm, have at some point or another gone out to scour the coast for barnacles and oysters. Those hard shells hide delicious treasures, if you know how to prepare them, and their relative rarity makes them a highly sought-after ingredient. 

1. In a large bowl, combine the juniper berries, white wine, and vinegar to create a marinade. Add the scallops, turning to coat. Let sit for about 20 minutes while you prepare the bacon. 
||
2 . In a medium saute pan or skillet over medium heat, cook the bacon until crispy. Transfer the bacon to paper towels to drain, then crumble into a small bowl and set aside. Drain the fat from the pan. 
||
3. When you're ready to cook the scallops, melt the butter in the pan over medium heat. Remove the scallops from the marinade, reserving the liquid. Arrange some of the scallops in the pan, flat-side down, leaving some space in between them. Sear until they are a nice golden brown, roughly 3 minutes. Flip the scallops and cook for another 3 minutes to brown the other side. Remove to a separate plate and cook the rest of the scallops until all of the scallops have been cooked. Set aside while you finish up the sauce. 
||
4. Add the garlic to the pan and cook until fragrant and golden brown, about 3 minutes. Add the reserved marinade liquid along with the maple syrup and simmer until the sauce is somewhat reduced and thickened, about 3 to 5 minutes. 
||
5. To serve, sprinkle the crumbled bacon on a plate and set the scallops on top. Drizzle the sauce over the scallops. 

3 tablespoons butter||
1 leek, diced||
I to 2 medium carrots, diced||
¼ cup heavy cream||
½ teaspoon Stormcloak Seasoning, plus a little extra pepper to taste||
2 to 3 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese||
I sheet puff pastry, thawed||
1 pound salmon fillet||
1 egg, beaten||

Salmon can be seen leaping up the current of the White River in great numbers, making them a popular ingredient for cooking. There are myriad ways to catch them-arrows and bolts work well, but a skillfully deployed destruction spell can yield a number of fish quickly. Simply baking the fi.sh .~ith some herbs will result in a delicious meal, but nobles often prefer it baked into a pastry case. 

1. Begin by melting the butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add the diced leek and carrots to the pan and cook for around 15 minutes, until the leeks are soft and the carrots are beginning to soften. Pour in the heavy cream then sprinkle in the ½ teaspoon of Storm cloak Seasoning and pepper. Let the mixture simmer for a minute or two until the cream has cooked down a bit and has been partially absorbed. Remove from heat and stir in the cheese. Set aside to cool. 
||
2. Preheat the oven to 375°F and line a baking sheet with parchment paper. 
||
3. Lay the puff pastry dough on a lightly floured surface. Roll out the dough a bit until you have a rectangle that is large enough to wrap around the whole salmon fillet. Sprinkle the remaining Stormcloak Seasoning over the middle of the dough, then place the salmon on top of the seasoning. Spread the vegetable mix evenly over the fish, then brush the edges of the dough with the beaten egg. Fold the long sides of the pastry over the fish and vegetables, overlapping the pastry in the middle, then press the egg-washed seam together. Brush the sides of the pastry with egg and tuck them over the top seam toward the middle as far as they will go, also pressing them down. 
||
4. Gently flip the salmon onto the prepared baking sheet so that the seam is facing down. Lightly score the top of the dough only partway through with a sharp knife, then brush with the remaining egg. Bake for about 25 to 30 minutes, until the top is a nice golden brown. Let cool for a few minutes before slicing and serving. 


6 chicken drumsticks (about 2 cups cooked meat)
2 tablespoons butter
1 leek, both white and light green parts sliced into thin half-moons
1 or 2 cloves garlic, minced
1 medium carrot, peeled and diced
½ teaspoon Stormcloak Seasoning
1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
¾ cup heavy cream
¼ cup shredded cheddar cheese
Salt and pepper
1 recipe Rye Pie Dough
1 egg, beaten, for glazing

These dumplings are a specialty of many an inn across Skyrim, where travelers can enjoy them hot after a long day's journey, but they're also a popular pick in one's own homestead kitchen. In either case, the creamy filling has restorative properties, especially washed down with a flagon of the local specialty.

1. Preheat the oven to 375°F and place the drumsticks on a baking sheet. Bake for 30 minutes, then flip and return to the oven for another 30 minutes, until cooked through. 
||
2. While the drumsticks cook, melt the butter in a large saute pan or skillet over medium heat, then add the leeks. Cook for several minutes, until the leeks are soft but not browning. Add the garlic, carrot, and Stormcloak Seasoning, and cook for another couple of minutes, until the carrots have softened a bit. Sprinkle the mixture with flour, then stir to combine completely. Gradually pour in the heavy cream, stirring all the while, and when you have a nice thick consistency, remove from the heat and stir in the cheese. Season with salt and pepper to taste. 
||
3. When the chicken is done cooking, strip the meat from the bones and tear into small pieces. Add these to the cream filling mixture, stirring to incorporate. Lower the oven to 350°F. 
||
4. Roll out the Rye Pie Dough to ½ of an inch thick and shape into a rough square. Cut the dough into 4 even squares, adding a little dough here and there if needed to maintain the shape. 
||
5. Working one at a time, lay a square of dough out on a clean baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Divide the filling into 4 equal portions, and scoop one portion onto the square of dough, spreading it out evenly but leaving at least ½ inch bare around the edges. 
||
6. Dampen those bare edges with a little water, then take 2 of the corners and fold them toward the middle. Pinch together, then repeat with the other 2 corners. This should create seams that you can pinch closed. Repeat with the remaining dough and filling. 
||
7. Brush the dumplings with the beaten egg and bake for about 30 minutes, or until the tops are just starting to turn golden. Allow to cool slightly before enjoying. 
||
Tips: 
You can skip the first step of this recipe if you already have leftover chicken. You'll need about 2 cups.
